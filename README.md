<h1 align="center">Discord Status ðŸ“ˆ</h1>

Automatically be notified when [Discord's status page](https://discordstatus.com) receives an update.

Discord Status has two modes:
  - edit:
    - Every status page incident gets its own message, which will be edited every time there is an update.
    - `/config mode mode: edit`
  - post:
    - A new message will be posted with each update.
    - `/config mode mode: post`

Wanna be pinged when there's an update? Discord Status does that too :D
  - `/config roles add role: <r-id>`
  - `/config roles remove role: <r-id>`

Discord Status can also show you the current status of status page components and voice regions:
  - `/status summary`
  - `/status voice`
