> What data do I store

I store:
- webhook token
- webhook ID
- role IDs
- guild ID
- status page incident data:
  - incident ID
  - incident update IDs
  - message ID

> Where is my data stored?

All data is stored in a MongoDB database on an encrypted drive.

> What is it used for?

When you post a message in an announcement channel, the bot checks if that channel is configured to have messages automatically published.

> I would like to have my data removed

Delete the webhook from your server and it will be automatically deleted from the database within 24 hours
